# Results Table Generator

Java files in [JavaCode](https://github.com/uwec-recreation/uwec-recreation.github.io/tree/master/results-table-generator/JavaCode) generate [results.html](https://github.com/uwec-recreation/uwec-recreation.github.io/blob/master/results-table-generator/results.html) file from prizes.csv, raffleprizes.csv, and entries.csv.

The tables in results.html can then be copied to [prizes.html](https://github.com/uwec-recreation/uwec-recreation.github.io/blob/master/prizes.html) to make it easy to add all of the winners, ticket, and fish information to the website.
