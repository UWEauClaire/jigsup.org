				<h2>Lake Wissota</h2>
				<p>
					Lake Wissota is a reservoir in Chippewa County, Wisconsin, United States, just east of the city of Chippewa Falls.
					It covers an area of 6,024 acres (2,438 ha) and has a maximum depth of 72 feet (22 m).
				</p>
				<p>
					Lake Wissota is surrounded on the south by the town of Lafayette, on the north and east by the town of Anson, and on the west by the town of Eagle Point.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lake is divided into two parts by a peninsula upon which is the center of Lake Wissota Village. The smaller southern portion of the lake, the
					flooded portion of the valley formed by Paint Creek, is often called "Little Lake Wissota". The larger portion of the lake, lying to the north of
					Lake Wissota Village, is usually just called "Lake Wissota", although it is sometimes also called "Big Lake Wissota". The lake is fed by several
					other rivers and streams besides the Chippewa River, which enters the lake from the northwest and exits to the southwest, and Paint Creek which
					enters Little Lake Wissota from the east, respectively. These include Stillson Creek, which enters Little Lake Wissota from the southwest, the
					Yellow River which enters from the east at Moon Bay, and O'Neil Creek, which enters in the northwest, near the entrance of the Chippewa River.
					The lake is a popular recreation destination in northwestern Wisconsin, in the summer for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing, and swimming, and in the winter
					for ice fishing. On the northeastern shore lies Lake Wissota State Park, popular with campers, hikers, swimmers, and anglers.

			<h2>Chippewa Falls</h2>
			<p>
				Chippewa Falls is a city located on the Chippewa River in Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 13,661 at the 2010 census.
				Incorporated as a city in 1869, it is the county seat of Chippewa County.
			</p>
			<p>
				The city's name originated because of its location on the Chippewa River, which is named after the Ojibwa Native Americans. Chippewa is
				an alternative rendition of Ojibwa.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chippewa Falls is the birthplace of Seymour Cray, known as the "father of supercomputing", and the headquarters for the original Cray Research.
				It is also the home of the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, the Heyde Center for the Arts, a showcase venue for artists and performers,
				Irvine Park, and the annual Northern Wisconsin State Fair. Chippewa Falls is also 15 miles from the annual four-day music festivals Country Fest
				and Rock Fest.
			</p>
			<h2>Eau Claire</h2>
			<p>
				Eau Claire took its name from Eau Claire County. "Eau Claire" is the singular form of the original French name, "Eaux Claires",
				meaning "Clear Waters", for the Eau Claire River. According to local legend, the river was so named because early French explorers
				journeying down the rain-muddied Chippewa River, happened upon the Eau Claire River, excitedly exclaiming "Voici l'eau claire!"
				("Here [is] clear water!"), the city motto, which appears on the city seal. The name is pronounced as if it were spelled "O'Clare".
			</p>
			<p>
				The city was founded near the confluence of the Eau Claire and Chippewa rivers as three separate settlements.
				The main section of downtown is on the site of the original village, where Stephen McCann, in partnership with J. C. Thomas,
				put up three buildings in 1845. Although these structures were erected to establish a claim to the land they stood on, the McCann
				family moved into one of them and became the first permanent settlers.[12] West Eau Claire, founded in 1856, was across the river
				near the present-day county courthouse, and incorporated in 1872. Between a mile and a half and two miles downstream, the Daniel Shaw
				&amp; Co. lumber company founded Shawtown, which was annexed by the 1930s.[citation needed] By the 1950s, the entire city had spread far
				enough to the east to adjoin Altoona.
